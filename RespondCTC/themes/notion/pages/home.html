			<p id="paragraph-1">Notion is a clean, simple theme from the creators of Respond.  It features a simple Bootstrap-based layout, a dynamic slide-out menu, and support for all the built-in widgets that ship with Respond. The slide-out menu in Modern is the hallmark of the experience.  It uses CSS3 animations to animate the menu icon and a smooth transition to slide it from the side.</p>
